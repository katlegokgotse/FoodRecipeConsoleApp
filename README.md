MakingRecipeConsoleApp is a console project using C# for my 2nd year in Rosebank College 1st Semester. So this program should be able to add, edit and clear values in a recipe.
When the program is run it displays an array of options which will show the user 6 options
1. Create a recipe: This option will be used to by the user to enter. The amount of ingredients they want. The name of the ingredient. The amount of the measurement. The unit of measurement which the user will use. The description on how to make the ingredient.
2. Display the recipe: This will display the recipe by The amount of ingredients, The name of the ingredient. The amount of the measurement. The unit of measurement which the user will use. The description on how to make the ingredient.
3. Scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5, 2, 3: This should increase the quantity of the ingredient by either half, double or triple.
4. Revert the scale changes: This should revert the changes made in (3) back to the ones the user has created. 
5. Clear the array: This will be used to clear the user's information.
6. Exit the program: Self explainatory.
